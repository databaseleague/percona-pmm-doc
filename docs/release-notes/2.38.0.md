## Release Highlights

### Important security updates

- As security is paramount to us, starting with PMM 2.38.0, we have laid a solid and modernized enterprise-grade foundation for PMM. We have migrated our base operating system on which we build our base image from Enterprise Linux 7 ( CentOS 7) to Enterprise Linux 9 (EL9). Thus starting with PMM 2.38.0, we have made PMM publicly available on EL9 (Oracle Linux 9) as an early preview.

    The benefits of this migration are manifold. The migration fixes a large number of CVEs and improves upstream's response time to security-related issues. You can access more modern libraries to build on long with better compatibility with new technologies. 

    Although this update is incredible, it does have its set of limitations. Thus, we will be rolling this out in phases. 

    The following groups will be able to take advantage of this immediately:

    - Brand new installations of PMM, regardless of how you choose to run it
        * Docker: substitute perconalab/pmm-server:2.37.0-el9 in the docker run commands
        * OVF: [Download](https://downloads.percona.com/downloads/pmm2/2.37.0/ova/pmm-server-2.37.0-el9.ova) it directly from percona.com.
    - Docker/Podman users that do full container replacement upgrades to newer versions of PMM*
        * substitute perconalab/pmm-server:2.37.0-el9 in the docker run commands

    Groups that will need to wait a bit longer:

    - AMI users
    - Users that exclusively upgrade through the UI’s “Upgrade Now” button
    - OVF users



### Improved nodes view on the Inventory page

In our continuing endeavor to enhance user experience, we further improved the **Inventory** page by improving the **Nodes** tab. With this change, you can get more context on your inventory objects, such as node, and more actionable information for exploring and resolving possible issues.

Here is the change as part of PMM 2.38.0:

- You can see the number of agents running on any particular node. When you click on any node, the UI navigates to the view of agents, which is filtered to display only agents related to that specific node. 

To see the details of the agents running, do the following:

On the **Nodes** tab, under the **Monitoring** column, click **OK** or **Failed** depending on the status of the node that you have selected. A page that provides the user with crucial information regarding the total number of agents deployed on that node is displayed.

- You can also view comprehensive information about each agent, including key attributes such as node type, IP address, and associated services. This gives you a complete overview of the nodes at a glance.

- You can check the health status of the agents to see if they are running or have failed.

### MongoDB backup enhancements

#### Sharded cluster backup support
This release introduces support for working with backups for sharded clusters. PMM handles the backup process end-to-end, but restoring such artifacts is currently possible only via the CLI, using Percona Backup for MongoDB.

For information on restoring sharded backups, check the [PBM documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-backup-mongodb/usage/restore.html)


#### Better folder management for enhanced PMB compatibility 
We’ve added a new **Folder** field to the Create Backup pages. Use this to specify a specific target directory within the selected local or S3-compatible location for the backup.  

Organizing backups in folders makes grouping PBM backups for clusters easier, and it improves PMM-PBM integration workflows. For example, it enables you to switch between the PBM CLI and PMM UI when creating backups, or add snapshots to running PITR backups.

The **Folder** field is automatically populated with the value of the cluster label. You can change this default folder from PMM’s Advanced Settings. However,  this is not recommended since it can…
